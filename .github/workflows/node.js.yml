# Name of your workflow
name: Deploy React App to GitHub Pages

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-deploy"
  build-and-deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up Node.js on the runner, specifying a version
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # You can specify any Node.js version you need

      # Step 3: Installs your project's dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'npm ci' is often faster and more reliable for CI environments than 'npm install'

      # Step 4: Runs the build script defined in your package.json (creates the 'build' folder)
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Deploys the content of the 'build' folder to the 'gh-pages' branch
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
